# Earthquake Challenge

## Assignment Objective

In the past, I helped Basil and Sadhana with creating visualization for Earthquakes. They liked how I created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. 

Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
